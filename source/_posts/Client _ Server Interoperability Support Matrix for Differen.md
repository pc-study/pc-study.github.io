Information in this document applies to any platform.
# PURPOSE
 Use this note to understand which Oracle client versions are supported to work with which versions of the Oracle Database.
# DETAILS
**Oracle Client / Server Interoperability Support**

Use this note to understand which Oracle client versions are supported to work with which versions of the Oracle Database.

# INTRODUCTION
This note gives a summary of the support for interoperability between Oracle client and server versions. This includes support for connections over database links between Oracle versions.

Note that this is a general guide for interoperability only - certain products or utilities may impose additional restrictions on supported combinations specific to the product / utility. eg: Precompilers, Export / Import utilities etc.  For example, if you are seeking WLS / JDBC driver information, please see Document 1970437.1 instead of using the tables below.

For a summary of the support status of each Oracle release see **Note 161818.1**

# GENERAL POLICY
Oracle's general policy is to test and support each new Oracle release for compatibility with older releases thus:
- Test the **NEW** client to each **OLDER** server release where the **OLDER** release is still covered by Premier Support (formerly Primary Error Correction support) at the time that the **NEW** version is released.
- Test **OLDER** clients to the **NEW** server release where the **OLDER** release is still covered by Premier Support (formerly Primary Error Correction support) **OR** is in the first two years of Extended Support (formerly Extended Maintenance support).
- Tests between the **NEW** version and other **OLDER** releases may be added where Oracle deems it sensible to support interoperability between those releases.
# CURRENT INTEROPERABILITY SUPPORT SITUATION
The matrix below summarizes client and server combinations that are supported for the most commonly used product versions. A full matrix appears at the end of this document.

New interoperability problems will only be investigated if **BOTH** releases involved are covered by a valid support contract at the time that the issue is reported.

**Specific Notes:**
- **#1** - See **Note 207319.1**
- **#2** - An ORA-3134 error is incorrectly reported if a 10g client tries to connect to an 8.1.7.3 or lower server. See **Note 3437884.8** .
- **#3** - An ORA-3134 error is correctly reported when attempting to connect to this version.
- **#4** - There are problems connecting from a 10g client to 8i/9i where one is EBCDIC based. See **Note 3564573.8**
- **#5** - For connections between 10.2 (or higher) and 9.2 the 9.2 end MUST be at 9.2.0.4 or higher. Connections between 10.2 (or higher) and 9.2.0.1, 9.2.0.2 or 9.2.0.3 have never been supported.
- **#6** - For connections between 11.1 (or higher) database server and 10.1 / 10.2 database server across a database link the 10g end MUST be at 10.1.0.5 / 10.2.0.2 (or higher) respectively in order to use PLSQL between those versions. (This does not apply to normal 11g clients to 10g database server only server to server and a few very specific client products, such as Oracle Forms). See **Note 4511371.8** for more details.
- **#7** - For database link connections between 11.1 (or higher) and 10.2 the 10g end MUST be at 10.2.0.2 (or higher) in order to use PLSQL between those versions. See **Note 4511371.8** for more details.
- **#8** - Attempting to connect from 9.2 to 12.1 will fail with an "ORA-28040: No matching authentication protocol" error.
- **#9** - 11.2.0.3 or 11.2.0.4 only. For Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, there is additional limitation and 11.2.0.4 is the minimum supported client version.
- **#10** - For the IBM z/OS platform only, Oracle will continue to test past 2014, at its discretion, new versions of the database running on non-z/OS platforms with the older 10.2 client running on z/OS. For more information, please refer to **Note 461234.1** - Oracle Database on z/OS Support Status.

**General Notes:**
- For **`database links`** between different Oracle versions connections must be supported in BOTH directions in the matrix above.
eg: As 11.2 -> 10.1 is not supported then database links between these version are **not** supported in either direction.
- Unsupported combinations may appear to work but can encounter errors for particular operations. The fact that they appear to work should not be relied upon - **issues on unsupported combinations will not be investigated.**
- Since new database servers are compatible with a limited set of older OCI clients, it may not be necessary to upgrade the client software when upgrading the database. However, some new features may not work without upgrading the client software. For example, an Oracle 10.2 client is able to connect to an 11.2 database, but is not able to take advantage of newer features such as Client Result Cache (introduced in 11.1).
- Oracle Applications , or other Oracle products, may have supported configurations not listed in the matrix above.
- The matrix above also applies between different platforms and between 32/64 bit releases of Oracle client / server except where any Oracle platform desupport notice indicates otherwise.
- Unix BEQUEATH (BEQ) connections are **NOT** supported between different releases. eg: Client 10.2 is not supported to make an Oracle Net connection to a 11.2 server using the BEQ protocol adapter regardless of the interoperability support listed above. See **Note 364252.1** for more details.
- "Oracle Client" product interoperabilities expressed in this document do not extend to other client products, such as the "Sql-plus Instant Client" product.
- In Oracle Database Cloud Service environments, interoperability of a specific version of client is dependent on the Database version being run as a part of the Database Cloud Service.
- There may be feature limitations based on the cloud service being used and you are requested to refer to the Cloud Service documentation for any such feature limitations.
