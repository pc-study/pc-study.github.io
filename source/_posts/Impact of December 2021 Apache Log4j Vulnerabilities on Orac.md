@[TOC](In this Document)
# PURPOSE
On December 10th, Oracle released [Security Alert CVE-2021-44228](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html) in response to the disclosure of a new vulnerability affecting Apache Log4j prior to version 2.15.

Subsequently, the Apache Software Foundation released Apache version 2.16 which addresses an additional vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046). Mitigation instructions from Apache for these issues also evolved over time.

This document details the Oracle Products and Versions affected by CVE-2021-45046. This information generally supersedes the information previously published for vulnerability CVE-2021-44228.

# SCOPE
This document applies to all Oracle products and Oracle cloud services.

# DETAILS
The initial content for this note was limited to the impact of the Apache Log4j vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 on Oracle products, for releases and versions that are in Premier Support or Extended Support under the Oracle Lifetime Support Policy. This obsolete note is archived as [MOS Note ID 2828594.1](https://www.modb.pro/db/213256) and will no longer be updated.

**Note:**
- Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of this vulnerability.
- **Reminder:** Oracle **strongly** recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay. For the most recent Critical Patch Updates, see [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/).
- [Apache reported](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html) that CVE-2021-44228 applies only to Log4j versions 2.0-2.14.1, and does not apply to Log4j versions 1.x.
- [Apache reported](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html) that CVE-2021-45046 applies only to Log4j versions 2.0-2.15, and does not apply to Log4j versions 1.x.
- **Oracle believes at the time of the publication of this document that product releases that are not listed in Tables 1-4 below are not affected by this vulnerability in their default product distribution.**

**This page was last updated on: December 15, 2021 at 11:53 PM PST.**

## Applicability of these vulnerabilities to Oracle cloud environments

The Oracle cloud operations and security teams are evaluating all information related to CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-44228. They are evaluating all relevant third-party fixes as they become available.

Oracle will perform the required remediation activities (patches and mitigations) in accordance with applicable change management processes. This MOS note will be updated to provide information about the remedial status of all Oracle cloud environments (e.g., Oracle Applications, Oracle NetSuite, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle Industry Clouds, etc.).

Note that patching and mitigation activities in these environments have been ongoing since the initial release of the Alert, and some customers may have already received notifications of mandatory maintenance (if the maintenance resulted in a noticeable impact such as service interruption).

## Applicability of Security Alert CVE-2021-45046 to Oracle on-premises products

This section provides information about the availability of patches or mitigation instructions for products physically located in customers’ on-premise locations (including traditionally licensed products and cloud on-premises components).

## 1.0 Oracle products with patches or mitigation available

Updates released in response to CVE-2021-45046 are pending and will address CVE-2021-44228. Information about patches previously released in response to CVE-2021-44228 have been archived in MOS Note 2828594.1.
